        Lets explore the significance of poster representation and the unique power it holds in conveying ideas. The Poster presentation competition 'Posterama' is an innovative and an impactful opportunity to showcase graphic skills and potential in the field of graphic design and art. Posters should present a complex idea or message in a simple and distilled form that would strike the minds of the viewer at once. Your participation would be highly solicited in this event through your versatile perspective to the minds of observers. The EL & TC SOCIETY invites you to a rousing technical fest, TECHTRONIX. Vibe with us during this learning adventure where you can learn and enjoy at the same time`,
